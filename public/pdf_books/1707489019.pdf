A letter is a message written for a variety of purposes, from friendly to formal. They can
help maintain bonds between friends, especially if they’re far apart. Letters are also
used by professionals to communicate their concerns. In some schools, kids are
encouraged to write letters to Santa for Christmas. There are also letters given by
school administrators to the students’ parents or guardians.
If you’re thinking of writing a letter yourself, make your intentions clear from the start.
You can be fun and creative or straightforward, depending on your needs. Most letters
are divided into sections, including the date, recipient’s name, and salutations. As for
the main content of your letter, there are often three main parts: the introduction,
paragraph, and conclusion.
Your letter’s introduction can be a brief greeting, a few polite statements, or a
background of why you’re writing. The paragraph-1 is the bulk of your letter,
containing the most important parts of your message. Finally, the conclusion sums up
all your ideas. It can also include a closing statement or salutation. No matter what
reason you have behind writing, it’s best to be organized and plan the contents of
your letter before sending it out.
